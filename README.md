🌍 Currency Converter
This project is a Currency Converter built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS. The application allows users to convert currencies between different countries and includes a swap feature for reversing the selected currencies.

✨ Key Features
🔧 Custom Hook with useEffect:

I created a custom hook to handle the API call logic. The useEffect hook fetches currency conversion rates dynamically when the user selects different currencies or swaps them.
💱 Currency Conversion:

Users can input amounts, select currencies, and the app will convert from one currency to another using real-time data fetched from an external API.
🔄 Swap Functionality:

A swap button was implemented to switch the 'from' and 'to' currencies, allowing users to quickly reverse the conversion.
🌐 API Integration:

I utilized an API to fetch the latest conversion rates. The custom hook ensures efficient data fetching whenever the currency selections change.
🎨 UI/UX with Tailwind CSS:

Tailwind CSS was used to design a clean and responsive interface, enhancing the user experience. Transitions, hover effects, and modern UI features were integrated for seamless interaction.
